# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Auth Profiles Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Consolidate and enhance the authentication profiles system to provide a unified, well-typed profile management solution with role-based access control and support for multiple profile types.

## User Stories

### User Profile Management

As a platform user, I want to have a comprehensive profile that tracks my activity, preferences, and role within the platform, so that I can have a personalized experience and proper access to features.

The user should be able to create their profile during registration, update their information at any time, and have their role (user, creator, admin) properly reflected in their access permissions. The system should track profile completeness and encourage users to fill out missing information.

### Creator Profile Enhancement

As a creator, I want my profile to showcase my work, track my earnings, and manage my business information, so that I can effectively monetize my card designs and build my brand.

Creators should have access to additional profile fields like portfolio URL, specialties, commission rates, and tax information. The system should seamlessly upgrade a regular user to creator status when they start creating cards for sale.

### Admin Role Management

As an admin, I want to manage user roles and permissions through a secure interface, so that I can maintain platform security and provide appropriate access levels.

Admins should be able to view and modify user roles, see audit logs of profile changes, and have access to administrative features based on their permission level.

## Spec Scope

1. **Profile Table Consolidation** - Merge profiles, user_profiles, and creator_profiles into a single unified table
2. **TypeScript Type System** - Create comprehensive type definitions for all profile data with proper validation
3. **Role-Based Access Control** - Implement user, creator, and admin roles with appropriate permissions
4. **Profile Types Support** - Enable personal, creator, and business profile types with specific fields
5. **Profile Completeness Tracking** - Calculate and display profile completion percentage with suggestions

## Out of Scope

- Social media OAuth integration
- Two-factor authentication implementation
- Profile import/export functionality
- Advanced privacy controls beyond basic settings

## Expected Deliverable

1. Unified profile system with backward-compatible migration
2. Strongly-typed profile service with comprehensive validation
3. Working role-based access control with proper UI restrictions
