## Overview

Implement advanced material effects and realistic lighting for 3D card rendering to elevate visual quality and create professional-grade card designs that rival physical trading cards. This feature will add metallic finishes, holographic effects, dynamic lighting, and surface details to make CRD cards visually stunning and commercially competitive.

## User Stories

### Professional Card Designer

As a professional card designer, I want to apply realistic material effects like metallic finishes and holographic surfaces, so that my digital cards have the same visual impact and premium feel as high-end physical trading cards.

**Detailed Workflow**: Designer selects a card template, navigates to the materials panel, chooses from preset materials (matte, glossy, metallic, holographic), adjusts material properties (roughness, metallic intensity, reflection), and previews the card in real-time with dynamic lighting. The system provides instant feedback showing how the card will look under different lighting conditions.

### Content Creator

As a content creator, I want to easily apply stunning visual effects to my cards without technical knowledge, so that I can create professional-looking cards that stand out in the marketplace and attract more buyers.

**Detailed Workflow**: Creator uploads their card design, selects from a library of preset material effects (legendary foil, chrome finish, rainbow holographic), applies the effect with a single click, and customizes intensity levels using simple sliders. The system automatically optimizes the material for the card's content and provides export options for different quality levels.

### Card Collector

As a card collector, I want to view cards with realistic lighting and material effects, so that I can appreciate the craftsmanship and visual appeal of digital cards similar to how I would examine physical cards.

**Detailed Workflow**: Collector browses the card gallery, clicks on a card to view in 3D mode, rotates and zooms the card to see material effects from different angles, and experiences dynamic lighting that responds to mouse movement. The system provides smooth 60fps rendering and realistic material responses to lighting changes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Material System** - Implement physically-based rendering (PBR) materials including metallic, roughness, and normal map support
2. **Lighting Engine** - Add dynamic lighting with rim lighting, ambient occlusion, and environmental reflections
3. **Preset Materials** - Create library of preset materials (matte, glossy, metallic, holographic, foil effects)
4. **Surface Details** - Implement embossing, debossing, and texture mapping for card surfaces
5. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure 60fps rendering on mobile devices with material effects enabled

## Out of Scope

- Advanced shader programming interface for custom materials
- Real-time ray tracing effects
- Particle systems integration (separate feature)
- Video material effects or animated textures
- AR/VR specific material optimizations

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Interactive Material Panel** - Users can select and customize materials with real-time preview
2. **High-Quality 3D Rendering** - Cards render with realistic materials and lighting at 60fps on desktop, 30fps minimum on mobile
3. **Material Presets Library** - At least 12 preset materials covering common card finishes (matte, glossy, metallic variants, holographic effects)
