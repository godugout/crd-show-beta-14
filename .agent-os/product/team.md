## **Collaboration Workflows**

### **Multi-Agent Problem Solving**

#### Step 1: Problem Definition (Product Owner)

```
PROBLEM: "Card creation flow has 73% drop-off rate at step 3"
SUCCESS CRITERIA: "Reduce drop-off to <30%, maintain quality"
CONSTRAINTS: "Mobile-first, maintain current feature set"
```

#### Step 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis

- **ARIA**: "UX analysis shows cognitive overload - too many options presented simultaneously"
- **JACK**: "The copy is confusing users - 'Configure advanced settings' sounds intimidating"
- **DR. CHEN**: "Performance bottleneck - step 3 loads 15MB of assets synchronously"

#### Step 3: Collaborative Solution Design

- **ARIA**: Progressive disclosure UI with smart defaults
- **JACK**: Rewrite copy to be encouraging: "Let's make your card amazing"
- **DR. CHEN**: Lazy load assets, preload next step in background

#### Step 4: Implementation Planning

- **Priority**: High (affects core conversion)
- **Timeline**: 3 days (1 day each specialist)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Testing**: A/B test new flow vs current
