## 2024-07-26: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

CRD Show Beta 14 will be a revolutionary digital card creation platform that democratizes professional-grade card design, enabling anyone to create, share, and monetize collectible cards without traditional licensing barriers. The platform will target content creators, card collectors, sports teams, parents, and traditional card shops with a focus on mobile-first design, 3D graphics, and social features.

### Context

The traditional card industry faces significant barriers including expensive licensing agreements, limited accessibility for creators, and declining physical market relevance. CRD Show addresses these challenges by providing professional-grade tools accessible to everyone, bypassing licensing restrictions through copyright-safe recognition systems, and bridging digital and physical collecting experiences.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Licensing Model**
   - Pros: Established market, proven revenue model, brand recognition
   - Cons: Prohibitive costs, limited accessibility, slow innovation cycles

2. **Cryptocurrency-Based Platform**
   - Pros: Decentralized ownership, provable scarcity, blockchain benefits
   - Cons: Adoption barriers, regulatory uncertainty, technical complexity

3. **Physical-Only Approach**
   - Pros: Traditional market familiarity, proven business model
   - Cons: Limited scalability, declining market, no digital innovation

4. **Freemium SaaS Model**
   - Pros: Predictable revenue, subscription stability, enterprise focus
   - Cons: Limited creator monetization, reduced accessibility, platform dependency

### Rationale

The chosen approach combines the best elements of multiple models while addressing key market gaps:

- **Democratization**: Professional tools accessible to everyone regardless of skill level
- **Copyright Innovation**: Recognition via city/color identity without trademark infringement
- **Web2-First**: Virtual tokens without cryptocurrency complexity for mainstream adoption
- **Hybrid Model**: Digital creation with physical production bridge for traditional market appeal
- **Creator Economics**: 70% revenue share to attract and retain top talent

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero licensing costs enable global scalability
- Professional tools democratize card creation
- Mobile-first approach reaches broader audience
- Social features drive viral growth and engagement
- Physical bridge appeals to traditional collectors

**Negative:**
- Complex technical implementation for 3D graphics
- Need to educate traditional market on digital value
- Competition from established players with deep pockets
- Regulatory uncertainty around digital collectibles
- High performance requirements for mobile 60fps target

## 2024-07-26: Technical Architecture Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

CRD Show Beta 14 will use React 18 with TypeScript, Supabase for backend, Three.js for 3D graphics, and Capacitor for mobile deployment. The architecture prioritizes performance, security, and developer productivity with a mobile-first approach.

### Context

The platform requires high-performance 3D rendering, real-time collaboration, enterprise-grade security, and cross-platform mobile deployment. The chosen stack balances modern development practices with proven technologies for scalability and reliability.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Vue.js + Firebase**
   - Pros: Simpler learning curve, integrated backend
   - Cons: Limited 3D ecosystem, vendor lock-in, less mature than React

2. **Angular + Custom Backend**
   - Pros: Enterprise features, strong typing
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve, slower development, overkill for MVP

3. **Svelte + PostgreSQL**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, modern syntax
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, limited 3D libraries, less mature

4. **Next.js + Prisma**
   - Pros: SSR benefits, strong database integration
   - Cons: Overkill for client-heavy app, slower development cycles

### Rationale

The chosen stack provides:

- **React 18**: Concurrent features for smooth 60fps performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for complex 3D and state management
- **Supabase**: Real-time features, RLS security, PostgreSQL power
- **Three.js**: Mature 3D ecosystem with excellent React integration
- **Capacitor**: Cross-platform mobile without app store complexity

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Excellent developer experience and productivity
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Proven scalability and performance
- Enterprise-grade security and reliability
- Future-proof technology choices

**Negative:**
- Complex 3D performance optimization required
- Learning curve for advanced Three.js features
- Potential vendor lock-in with Supabase
- Mobile performance challenges with 3D rendering

## 2024-07-26: Business Model Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Business
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Business Team

### Decision

CRD Show will use a creator marketplace model with 70% creator revenue share, virtual CRD token economy for engagement, and future physical production revenue. The platform will focus on democratizing creation rather than subscription fees.

### Context

The platform needs to attract top creators while building sustainable revenue streams. Traditional subscription models limit accessibility, while pure advertising models don't align with creator interests. The marketplace model aligns incentives between creators and platform.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Subscription Model**
   - Pros: Predictable revenue, enterprise appeal
   - Cons: Limits accessibility, reduces creator incentives

2. **Advertising-Based**
   - Pros: Free for users, scalable revenue
   - Cons: Poor user experience, doesn't align with creators

3. **Transaction Fees Only**
   - Pros: Simple model, aligns with usage
   - Cons: Limited revenue, doesn't encourage engagement

4. **Freemium with Premium Features**
   - Pros: Broad accessibility, clear upgrade path
   - Cons: Creates barriers, limits creator monetization

### Rationale

The marketplace model provides:

- **Creator Alignment**: 70% revenue share attracts top talent
- **User Accessibility**: Free creation tools democratize access
- **Sustainable Growth**: Revenue scales with platform usage
- **Engagement Incentives**: CRD tokens encourage participation
- **Future Expansion**: Physical production adds revenue stream

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Attracts high-quality creators with generous revenue share
- Democratizes access to professional tools
- Revenue scales with platform growth and usage
- Virtual economy encourages engagement and retention
- Physical bridge provides additional revenue stream

**Negative:**
- Requires significant creator acquisition and retention
- Marketplace success depends on creator quality and quantity
- Virtual token economy complexity
- Physical production requires additional partnerships and infrastructure
