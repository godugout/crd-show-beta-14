## Project Context
- Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS
- Uses Supabase for backend and authentication
- Features card creation, marketplace, auctions, and social features
- Has a custom CRD (Card) DNA system for templates

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Follow existing component patterns in src/components
- Use Tailwind classes with the custom crd-* color scheme
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks

## Key Technologies
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- UI: Shadcn/ui components, Framer Motion
- State: React hooks, Context API
- Routing: React Router v6

## When Writing Code
1. Always check existing patterns in similar files
2. Use the established color scheme (crd-dark, crd-blue, etc.)
3. Include proper TypeScript types
4. Add loading and error states
5. Follow the existing file structure

## Common Patterns
- Pages go in src/pages/
- Reusable components in src/components/
- Hooks in src/hooks/
- Services in src/services/
- Types in src/types/

## Important Notes
- This is a production app - ensure code quality
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Consider mobile responsiveness
- Maintain consistent UX patterns
