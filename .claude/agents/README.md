## ðŸš€ **How to Use Subagents**

### Automatic Delegation
Subagents are automatically invoked when Claude detects relevant tasks. They operate with their own context window, preserving your main conversation.

### Explicit Invocation
You can explicitly request a specific subagent:

```
> Use the react-typescript-reviewer to review my recent changes
> Have the supabase-database-specialist optimize this query
> Ask the ui-ux-component-specialist to improve accessibility
```

### Chaining Subagents
For complex tasks, you can chain multiple subagents:

```
> First use the react-typescript-reviewer to review the code, then use the testing-qa-specialist to add tests
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Best Practices**

1. **Be Specific**: Mention the exact subagent you want to use
2. **Provide Context**: Give the subagent enough information about your task
3. **Chain When Needed**: Use multiple subagents for complex workflows
4. **Review Results**: Always review the subagent's recommendations

## ðŸ“‹ **Subagent Capabilities**

Each subagent has access to specific tools:
- **Read**: File reading and analysis
- **Edit**: Code modification and improvement
- **Bash**: Terminal commands and build processes
- **Grep**: Code search and pattern matching
- **Glob**: File pattern matching

## ðŸ”§ **Customization**

You can modify any subagent by editing its `.md` file. The structure is:
- YAML frontmatter with configuration
- Detailed system prompt with specific instructions
- Checklists and best practices

## ðŸ“ˆ **Expected Benefits**

- **Faster Development**: Specialized expertise for specific tasks
- **Higher Quality**: Comprehensive review and optimization
- **Better Performance**: Optimized builds and runtime performance
- **Improved Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance
- **Enhanced UX**: Better accessibility and user experience

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Start**

1. **Start with automatic delegation**: Let Claude choose the right subagent
2. **Be explicit when needed**: Request specific subagents for specialized tasks
3. **Review and iterate**: Always review subagent recommendations
4. **Customize as needed**: Modify subagents to match your specific needs
